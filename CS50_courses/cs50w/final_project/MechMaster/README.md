## Distinctiveness and Complexity

MechMaster is a unique online learning platform that stands out from other projects in the course due to its innovative approach to education and its comprehensive feature set. While many projects in the course focused on basic CRUD operations, MechMaster implements a complex ecosystem of features including user profiles, course enrollment, a dynamic forum, and interactive quizzes.

The complexity of MechMaster is evident in various aspects:
- **Interactive Learning Experience**: Unlike other projects, MechMaster incorporates video lessons, online resources, and interactive quizzes within each course module, providing a rich and engaging learning experience.
- **User Profiles and Enrollment**: MechMaster's user profile system allows learners to track their progress, view their enrolled courses, and manage their learning journey.
- **Forum with Real-Time Updates**: The integrated forum fosters community engagement among learners. Real-time updates on likes and views in forum topics enhance the user experience.
- **Sophisticated Quiz System**: MechMaster's quiz system allows instructors to create quizzes with multiple-choice questions. It displays a score at the end.

The project is structured as follows:

- **academy**: The main Django app containing settings, URLs, and core project configurations.
- **users**: Manages user authentication, registration, and user profile functionality.
- **courses**: Handles courses, modules, lessons, and resources.
- **forum**: Implements the dynamic forum with categories, topics, and posts.
